# Contributing to Linux_Dot-NET_Installer
Thanks for your interest in Linux and .NET Development. My goal is to make installing .NET on Linux machines as quick and painless as possible by providing easily obtainable scripts to do so.(Also, it's open-source) I would love your input on anything that could improve this project. I want to make every contribution to this project as transparent and effortless as possible.Please note that I have code of conduct that everyone needs to follow moving forward in all interactions with the project.

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from the **( main branch )**.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, **( add tests )**.
3. If you've made any changes, updates or bug fixes add your name to the **( Contributors.md )** and add a detailed explanation of your changes.
4. Issue a pull request.
5. Let's get it merged.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/sonAndrew/Linux_Dot-NET_Installer/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a but by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sonAndrew/Linux_Dot-NET_Installer/issues); wow breezy, it's easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

You can see how to create a "Sample Bug Report: Format, Template And Examples" [here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/sample-bug-report/).

Great Bug Reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Note (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you've tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports and I am one of them.
